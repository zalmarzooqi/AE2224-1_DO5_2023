# Error codes

I added in some error codes to prevent the program from looping and doing things when something went wrong. Below you 
can find what the error codes mean.

- "__main__": You ran the error_coding.py file which you should only do if you are testing the error coding window 
gui
- 1: The program can't find which cases you selected. This most likely happened if the program is terminated.
- 2: Something went wrong with the data path. Please make sure to use the full source code (including the "Data" folder
from GitHub
- 3: No cases are selected to be analyzed.
- 4: No output folder was specified.
- 5: Something went wrong with the setup program. Trying again is the best option, if it still doesn't work hit me up.
